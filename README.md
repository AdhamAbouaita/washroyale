# 👑 Clash Royale Clone (budget edition) 🏰

> "Mom, can we have Clash Royale?"
> "We have Clash Royale at home."
> **The Clash Royale at home:**

Welcome to the **Clash Royale Clone**! Built entirely with **Vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML5 Canvas**, and roughly 50 cups of coffee ☕. No frameworks, no libraries, just pure, unadulterated DOM manipulation and math.

## 🎮 What is this?

It's a Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game where you deploy troops to destroy the enemy King Tower. It's basically the same as that *other* famous game, but without the microtransactions taking your lunch money. 💸

## ✨ Features (That Actually Work)

*   **🧠 AI Opponent:** It's not smart, but it tries its best. (It cheats with random delays, don't tell anyone).
*   **🧪 Elixir System:** Wait for the pink bar to fill up. Panic when it's empty. Realism!
*   **🏹 Arrows Spell:** Now with AOE damage! Rain destruction upon your foes (and hope you don't miss).
*   **🌉 Bridge Logic:** Troops actually walk *on* the bridge now! No more Jesus-walking on the river water. 🌊
*   **💥 Explosions:** Things flash white and spawn particles when they die. It's very dramatic. 🎭
*   **🏰 The Pocket:** Take a tower, and your spawn zone expands! Strategy level: 100.

## 🚀 How to Play

1.  **Clone the repo:** `git clone https://github.com/AdhamAbouaita/clashroyaleclone.git`
2.  **Open the file:** Double-click `index.html`.
3.  **Win:** Place troops. Watch them fight. Pray the AI doesn't spawn a P.E.K.K.A when you have no elixir.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **JavaScript (ES6):** Because who needs types? (Just kidding, TS we miss you).
*   **HTML5 Canvas:** For drawing circles and squares that pretend to be knights and giants.
*   **CSS Grid:** Because centering divs is still hard.

## 🐛 Known Bugs

*   Sometimes troops might get confused about the meaning of life and stand still.
*   The "AI" is just a random number generator in a trench coat.
*   If you lose, it's definitely a bug and not a skill issue. 🌚
