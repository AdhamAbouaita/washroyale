## 🛁 What is this?
**WASH ROYALE** is the legally distinct, soap-scented cousin of that *other* royale game. We took the mechanics you love, scrubbed off the copyright infringement, and polished it until it shined like a bald man's head. ✨

It's **Human vs. AI** (Artificial Incompetence) in a battle for hygiene supremacy!

## 🧽 Features (That actually work mostly!)
*   **🧼 Elixir System:** It regenerates like soap scum in a college dorm shower.
*   **🏰 Towers:** King Towers? Princess Towers? NAH. Think of them as **The Big Soap Dispenser** and the **Little Hand Sanitizers**.
*   **🃏 Cards:** Deploy troops that definitely aren't just colored circles with identity issues!
    *   **Knights** 🗡️ (They forgot their armor but brought a sword)
    *   **Giants** 🦍 (Big bois who hate buildings)
    *   **Archers** 🏹 (Shooting... dirty looks?)
    *   **ARROWS** ➡️ (Literally just yellow sticks of doom)
*   **🧠 AI Opponent:** It thinks. It plots. It occasionally walks into a wall. Just like a real player!
*   **🌊 The River:** A strict "No Swimming" zone. Our troops respect aquatic boundaries like responsible citizens.

## 🚀 How to Play
1.  **Clone this bad boy:** `git clone https://github.com/AdhamAbouaita/clashroyaleclone.git` (Ignore the URL name, we're rebranding!)
2.  **Open `index.html`:** In your browser. Any browser. Even Internet Explorer if you hate yourself.
3.  **Drag & Drop:** Or click & tap. Throw stuff on the board!
4.  **WIN:** Destroy the enemy King Tower before he makes you take a bath!

## 🐛 Known Bugs (We call them "Surprise Features")
*   Sometimes troops get confused about the meaning of life.
*   The King Tower wakes up looking CRANKY if you poke him.
*   Physics is merely a suggestion.
